### Seismic Survey

- SEAM AI challenge dataset
  
  - **Basement/Other**: Basement - Low S/N; Few internal Reflections; May contain volcanics in places.
  - **lope Mudstone A**: Slope to Basin Floor Mudstones; High Amplitude Upper and Lower Boundaries; Low Amplitude Continuous/Semi-Continuous Internal Reflectors.
  - **Mass Transport Deposit**: Mix of Chaotic Facies and Low Amplitude Parallel Reflections.
  - **Slope Mudstone B**: Slope to Basin Floor Mudstones and Sandstones; High Amplitude Parallel Reflectors; Low Continuity Scour Surfaces.
  - **Slope Valley**: High Amplitude Incised Channels/Valleys; Relatively low relief.
  - **Submarine Canyon System**: Erosional Base is U shaped with high local relief.
